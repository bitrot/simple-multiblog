Simple Multiblog
================
Simple Multiblog builds upon the awesome blog, [Simple](https://github.com/orf/simple), and 
adds multiple author functionality.  We loved the simplicity in UI/UX but gave up some of the 
architectural simplicity for some additional features.  However, we think the code base is still pretty easy to follow.  
Props go to [Simple](https://github.com/orf/simple), [Obtvse](https://github.com/NateW/obtvse), 
and [Dustin Curtis' Svbtle](http://dcurt.is/codename-svbtle) for an awesome chain of inspiration.

Simple Multiblog is maintained by [Ryan Macy](https://github.com/rmacy) and [Eric Haughee](https://github.com/ehaughee) 
under the name of [bitrot](https://github.com/bitrot).
